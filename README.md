## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

### Goal of the Project
The goal of this machine learning project is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis of a Boston Housing dataset. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients' homes (assuming you are a real estate agent).

### Achievements
•	Performed statistical measures on the Boston dataset to explore the data.
•	Trained a model using the decision tree algorithm with four different maximum depths.
•	Evaluated the model’s performance using coefficient determination R2, Grid Search and Cross Validation.
•	Chose the optimal model.
Used the model to estimate the best-selling price for different homes.

### Install

This project was done using **Python 2.7** that already supports the following Python libraries:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I installed the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included and I made sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer.




### Data

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

**Features**
1.  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-teacher ratio by town

**Target Variable**
4. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes
